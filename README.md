## Notes on problems

### day 1:
Not too difficult. Part 2 had a really dumb solution, but the problem is not to computationally difficult. It was done in order to debug a much more clever solution, but since it provided the correct answer so fast anyways, I did not bother with the clever solution.

### day 2:
My part 2 solution is pretty damn slow. It should be possible to make it much, much faster. 
I believe it's because of repeatedly creating strings. 

### day3: 
Felt better about these solutions, they made more sense and were alright to implement. 

### day4:
Solution felt pretty good. moslty a 2d char vector, nothing fancy. 

### day5:
Relatively simple once you combine the ranges. 

### day6:
Trickiest was reading the array in all kinds of weird ways. Not sure if it could be done more idiomatically, i ended up doing it mostly by indexing and for-loops like a good old C program. 

### day7:
part1 solution was done on the char-array. But even then it mostly smelled of graph traversal, and sure enough in part2 it's revelaed that's how you should have thought of it.
