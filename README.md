## Notes on problems

### day 1:
Not too difficult. Part 2 had a really dumb solution, but the problem is not to computationally difficult. It was done in order to debug a much more clever solution, but since it provided the correct answer so fast anyways, I did not bother with the clever solution.

### day 2:
My part 2 solution is pretty damn slow. It should be possible to make it much, much faster. 
I believe it's because of repeatedly creating strings. 

### day3: 
Felt better about these solutions, they made more sense and were alright to implement.
